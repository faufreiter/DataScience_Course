    "\n",
    "Consider \"apparent temperature\" measures like the heat index and the wind chill. These quantities attempt to measure the *perceived* temperature to humans based on air temperature, humidity, and wind speed, things which we can measure directly. You could think of an apparent temperature as the result of a kind of feature engineering, an attempt to make the observed data more relevant to what we actually care about: how it actually feels outside!\n",
    "\n",
    "You might perform feature engineering to:\n",
    "- improve a model's predictive performance\n",
    "- reduce computational or data needs\n",
    "- improve interpretability of the results\n",

    "# A Guiding Principle of Feature Engineering #\n",
    "\n",
    "For a feature to be useful, it must have a relationship to the target that your model is able to learn. Linear models, for instance, are only able to learn linear relationships. So, when using a linear model, your goal is to transform the features to make their relationship to the target linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea here is that a transformation you apply to a feature becomes in essence a part of the model itself. Say you were trying to predict the `Price` of square plots of land from the `Length` of one side. Fitting a linear model directly to `Length` gives poor results: the relationship is not linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"../Data/Figs/fe1.png\" width=300, alt=\"A scatterplot of Length along the x-axis and Price along the y-axis, the points increasing in a curve, with a poorly-fitting line superimposed.\">\n",
    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>A linear model fits poorly with only Length as feature.\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we square the `Length` feature to get `'Area'`, however, we create a linear relationship. Adding `Area` to the feature set means this linear model can now fit a parabola. Squaring a feature, in other words, gave the linear model the ability to fit squared features.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"../Data/Figs/fe2.png\" width=600, alt=\"Left: Area now on the x-axis. The points increasing in a linear shape, with a well-fitting line superimposed. Right: Length on the x-axis now. The points increase in a curve as before, and a well-fitting curve is superimposed.\">\n",
    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center><strong>Left:</strong> The fit to Area is much better. <strong>Right:</strong> Which makes the fit to Length better as well.\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "This should show you why there can be such a high return on time invested in feature engineering. Whatever relationships your model can't learn, you can provide yourself through transformations. As you develop your feature set, think about what information your model could use to achieve its best performance."

    "The metric we'll use is called \"mutual information\". Mutual information is a lot like correlation in that it measures a relationship between two quantities. The advantage of mutual information is that it can detect *any* kind of relationship, while correlation only detects *linear* relationships.\n",

    "# Mutual Information and What it Measures #\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual information describes relationships in terms of *uncertainty*. The **mutual information** (MI) between two quantities is a measure of the extent to which knowledge of one quantity reduces uncertainty about the other. If you knew the value of a feature, how much more confident would you be about the target?\n",

    "From the figure, we can see that knowing the value of `ExterQual` should make you more certain about the corresponding `SalePrice` -- each category of `ExterQual` tends to concentrate `SalePrice` to within a certain range. The mutual information that `ExterQual` has with `SalePrice` is the average reduction of uncertainty in `SalePrice` taken over the four values of `ExterQual`. Since `Fair` occurs less often than `Typical`, for instance, `Fair` gets less weight in the MI score.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Technical note: What we're calling uncertainty is measured using a quantity from information theory known as \"entropy\". The entropy of a variable means roughly: \"how many yes-or-no questions you would need to describe an occurance of that variable, on average.\" The more questions you have to ask, the more uncertain you must be about the variable. Mutual information is how many questions you expect the feature to answer about the target.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interpreting Mutual Information Scores #\n",
    "\n",
    "The least possible mutual information between quantities is 0.0. When MI is zero, the quantities are independent: neither can tell you anything about the other. Conversely, in theory there's no upper bound to what MI can be. In practice though values above 2.0 or so are uncommon. (Mutual information is a logarithmic quantity, so it increases very slowly.)\n",

    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things to remember when applying mutual information:\n",
    "- MI can help you to understand the *relative potential* of a feature as a predictor of the target, considered by itself.\n",
    "- It's possible for a feature to be very informative when interacting with other features, but not so informative all alone. MI *can't detect interactions* between features. It is a **univariate** metric.\n",
    "- The *actual* usefulness of a feature *depends on the model you use it with*. A feature is only useful to the extent that its relationship with the target is one your model can learn. Just because a feature has a high MI score doesn't mean your model will be able to do anything with that information. You may need to transform the feature first to expose the association.\n",

    "# PCA for Feature Engineering #\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways you could use PCA for feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way is to use it as a descriptive technique. Since the components tell you about the variation, you could compute the MI scores for the components and see what kind of variation is most predictive of your target. That could give you ideas for kinds of features to create -- a product of `'Height'` and `'Diameter'` if `'Size'` is important, say, or a ratio of `'Height'` and `'Diameter'` if `Shape` is important. You could even try clustering on one or more of the high-scoring components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way is to use the components themselves as features. Because the components expose the variational structure of the data directly, they can often be more informative than the original features. Here are some use-cases:\n",
    "- **Dimensionality reduction**: When your features are highly redundant (*multicollinear*, specifically), PCA will partition out the redundancy into one or more near-zero variance components, which you can then drop since they will contain little or no information.\n",
    "- **Anomaly detection**: Unusual variation, not apparent from the original features, will often show up in the low-variance components. These components could be highly informative in an anomaly or outlier detection task.\n",
    "- **Noise reduction**: A collection of sensor readings will often share some common background noise. PCA can sometimes collect the (informative) signal into a smaller number of features while leaving the noise alone, thus boosting the signal-to-noise ratio.\n",
    "- **Decorrelation**: Some ML algorithms struggle with highly-correlated features. PCA transforms correlated features into uncorrelated components, which could be easier for your algorithm to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA basically gives you direct access to the correlational structure of your data. You'll no doubt come up with applications of your own!\n",

    "\n",
    "An encoding like this presents a couple of problems, however. First are *unknown categories*. Target encodings create a special risk of overfitting, which means they need to be trained on an independent \"encoding\" split. When you join the encoding to future splits, Pandas will fill in missing values for any categories not present in the encoding split. These missing values you would have to impute somehow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second are *rare categories*. When a category only occurs a few times in the dataset, any statistics calculated on its group are unlikely to be very accurate. In the *Automobiles* dataset, the `mercurcy` make only occurs once. The \"mean\" price we calculated is just the price of that one vehicle, which might not be very representative of any Mercuries we might see in the future. Target encoding rare categories can make overfitting more likely.\n",
